This code must be run on an Arduino Nano, and is designed to be run in the Ethernet unit of the HE-6 CRES Beta Monitor

new_rate_over_internet will take TTL inputs on Pin 5 of the nano and calculate a rate from that and multiply it by 10 before printing it to the serial monitor (attached computer) every second and upload to the IP every 5 seconds
This should be used for debugging the unit, as the upload speed is limited and much of the memory is wasted in printing to the monitor.

upload_code will do the same, but will not print to serial monitor and upload to the IP every 0.5 seconds.
This should be the code ran during data-taking

Notes:

The nano must also be connected to an ethernet module, as the arduino cannot host a page on its own.

The nano must recieve 5V TTL pulses on pin 5 to read a rate accurately. Any over this voltage threshold risks damage, and much below risks not being detected

The arduino will begin to break down at input frequencies over 125 MHz, hence the factor of 10

new_rate_over_internet will not refresh the page unless pinged, but upload_code will refresh on its own

Despite what's written in the code, the IP will only display a new value every other interval on the code. So the IP print speed for new_rate_over_internet is closer to 10 seconds, and upload_code is closer to every 1 second.
